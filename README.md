# Residential Healthcare Staffing & Incident Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between staffing coverage, supervisory presence, and client incident trends in a residential healthcare setting serving adults with serious mental illness and co-occurring conditions.

The goal of this analysis is to identify operational risk patterns and provide data-driven recommendations to improve client safety and program stability.

## Business Questions
- How do staffing ratios impact incident frequency?
- Are incidents more common during certain shifts?
- Does supervisory presence correlate with lower incident severity?

## Data
This project uses a simulated dataset modeled after real residential healthcare operations to protect confidentiality while maintaining realism.

Datasets include:
- Staff schedules and shift coverage
- Client incident reports
- Program capacity and acuity indicators

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Tableau / Power BI
- GitHub

## Key Findings
- Higher incident rates during evening and overnight shifts
- Increased severity when supervisory coverage was absent
- Staffing ratios above 1:6 correlated with increased incidents

## Recommendations
- Increase supervisory overlap during high-risk shifts
- Adjust staffing based on acuity, not just capacity
- Monitor overtime as a leading indicator of instability
